# **ITR Machine Learning Class - Lesson 01: Multiple Linear Regression**

---

### **Instructor: Danish Nadar**

This repository contains a practical demonstration of **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** conducted during Illinois Tech Robotics' Machine Learning Class. The session aimed to provide hands-on experience in building and evaluating regression models to predict a student's performance.

## **Overview**
### **What is Multiple Linear Regression?**
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a supervised learning technique that models the linear relationship between two or more independent variables (**e.g., Hours Studied, Previous Scores**) and one dependent variable (**Performance Index**). The goal is to make accurate predictions for the dependent variable.
