# **ITR Machine Learning Class 01 - Simple Linear Regression**  
### **Instructor: Danish Nadar**

This repository contains a practical demonstration of **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** conducted during Illinois Tech Robotics' Machine Learning Class. The session aimed to provide hands-on experience with foundational regression techniques in data science.

## **Overview**
### **What is Simple Linear Regression?**  
Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the linear relationship between one independent variable (**Height**) and one dependent variable (**Weight**). The goal is to predict the dependent variable based on new input data.

## **Libraries Used**
The following libraries were used in this project:

- **pandas:** For loading and manipulating structured data.
- **numpy:** For numerical computations on arrays.
- **matplotlib:** For visualizing data through plots.
- **seaborn:** For aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- **scikit-learn:** For machine learning model building.
